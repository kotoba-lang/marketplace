  "Returns and RMAs — the path to the `:refunded` escrow state that
  existed with no way to reach it.

  ## An RMA is not a dispute

  This distinction is the whole design. A DISPUTE is a contested claim:
  the buyer says one thing, the seller another, and somebody has to
  decide — which is why `marketplace.crossborder` refuses to, and why
  no actor in this fleet adjudicates.

  A RETURN is the seller's OWN PUBLISHED POLICY being applied to facts
  nobody disagrees about: the parcel was delivered on the 3rd, the
  window is 14 days, it is now the 9th, the category is returnable.
  Nothing there is contested, so `eligibility` can answer it
  mechanically — and refusing to, on the grounds that all decisions need
  humans, would make returns unusable while protecting nobody.

  What is NOT mechanical is the RESOLUTION. Whether a returned item was
  actually unopened, whether damage is the courier's or the buyer's, and
  whether money moves are judgements with money attached, so
  `resolve-return` requires a named human exactly as
  `marketplace.settlement/resolve-dispute` does.

  A DECLINED return is the bridge back: `->dispute-reason` maps it to
  the dispute vocabulary, because a buyer told 'policy says no' who
  disagrees now has a genuinely contested claim, and that is precisely
  what the dispute path is for.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness — `now` and the delivery
  date are the caller's."

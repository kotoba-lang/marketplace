(ns marketplace.catalog
  "Cross-seller offers on one canonical product — the piece that makes a
  marketplace a marketplace rather than a row of unrelated shops.

  The unit is the OFFER: (canonical product) × (seller) × (price,
  condition, availability). Many sellers may offer the same canonical
  product, which is exactly the Amazon/Alibaba-shaped affordance the
  fleet lacked. Product identity itself is NOT owned here — it comes
  from `kotoba.product-party` (GTIN-14 normalization + GS1 mod-10 check
  digit + `gtin.<14>` / `prod.<slug>` id shapes), and the canonical
  merge/split decision belongs to `cloud-itonami-gtin-catalog`'s
  ProductCatalogGovernor. This namespace consumes canonical ids; it
  never mints or merges them.

  ## Money

  Every amount is an INTEGER count of the currency's smallest
  circulating unit (`:offer/price-minor`), never a float — the same
  discipline `kotoba.reji` states outright ('money never touches a
  double/float, so there's no binary-decimal rounding error'). A JPY
  1,200 offer is `1200`; a USD $12.00 offer is `1200`. Currency is
  carried alongside and comparisons across currencies are refused
  rather than silently converted, because this library has no FX rate
  and inventing one would be fabrication.

  ## The buy box is explicit and auditable

  On a closed platform the 'which seller wins the buy box' function is
  the single most opaque and most rent-extracting mechanism there is.
  Here `buy-box` is a pure function that returns the full ranking WITH
  the comparison key that produced it, so an operator (or a seller who
  lost) can reproduce the decision exactly. There is no hidden
  boost, no paid placement, and no tie-break on anything the seller
  cannot observe.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

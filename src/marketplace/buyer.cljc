  "Buyer accounts — and a deliberate asymmetry with sellers.

  ## Why this is not `marketplace.seller` with the names changed

  A seller credential carries eKYC evidence and an AML screening because
  a seller RECEIVES money, and admitting one is a regulated act. A buyer
  SPENDS their own money on a book. Applying the same machinery to them
  would be both useless and harmful: useless because nothing in
  sanctions law requires identity-proofing a consumer purchase of
  household goods, and harmful because every field collected is a field
  that can leak.

  So this namespace is built the other way round — the question is not
  *how much can we verify?* but *how little do we need?*

  ## Levels, and what each is actually for

  `:guest` is a real, first-class level, not a degraded one. A buyer who
  never creates an account can still order: an operator that forces
  registration to sell someone a bottle of cola is collecting data it
  has no use for.

  Higher levels exist for specific, stated reasons — age-restricted
  goods, high-value orders, cross-border shipments needing a real
  consignee — and `purchase-errors` takes the REQUIRED level as an
  operator input rather than assuming one. There is no
  `:identity-verified` requirement baked in anywhere.

  ## Redaction is a first-class operation

  `redact` exists because this record will end up in audit ledgers,
  proposals and LLM context, and a buyer's address has no business being
  in any of them. Every actor that logs a buyer is expected to log
  `(redact buyer)`.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

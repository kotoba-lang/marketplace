(ns marketplace.order
  "The multi-seller order — the contract that ties listing, settlement,
  fulfillment and delivery into one thing a buyer recognises.

  ## Why this exists

  `kotoba.okaimono` already models an order beautifully: line items,
  totals, a COD flag, and an explicit status-transition table. But its
  order belongs to ONE store. A marketplace basket does not: its lines
  belong to different sellers, who pick, pack and ship independently and
  may deliver days apart.

  So a marketplace order is modelled as a PARENT over per-seller
  `okaimono` sub-orders — one sub-order per seller, each a genuine
  `okaimono` record that the courier and warehouse actors can consume
  unchanged. The parent owns only what is genuinely shared: the buyer,
  the currency, and the derived overall status.

  ## Status is derived, never asserted

  `overall-status` is COMPUTED from the sub-orders every time. There is
  deliberately no setter. A parent that stored its own status could
  disagree with its parts — a buyer told 'delivered' while one seller's
  parcel is still in a depot — and that disagreement is exactly the bug
  a marketplace cannot afford. The rule is conservative: an order is
  only `:delivered` when EVERY sub-order is, and any sub-order still
  moving keeps the whole order in flight.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

  sub-orders, seller-sorted so the same basket always produces the same
  structure.

  Returns nil when any line is unusable — `kotoba.okaimono/line` is the
  arbiter of that, so quantity/price validation lives in one place

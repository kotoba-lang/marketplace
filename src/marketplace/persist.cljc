  "Durable storage for marketplace actors — over an INJECTED database
  API, never a required one.

  ## Why this namespace requires nothing

  `manifest/org-database-policy.edn` and its ADR draw a hard line: *the
  host owns D1 binding/transport construction, tenant/database/ref
  selection, CACAO authorization, encryption/decryption, blind indexing,
  visibility policy, pooling, migrations and secrets. Product modules
  receive an already-open database.* `kotobase.engine/open` enforces the
  same thing from the other side — it throws unless every security
  control (`encrypt-fn`, `decrypt-fn`, `blind-fn`, `visible?`) is
  supplied explicitly.

  So this namespace takes a `db-api` map of the four functions it needs
  and requires no storage library at all:

  ```clojure
  {:transact! (fn [tx-data] ...)   ; kotobase.core/transact! partial'd on db
   :q         (fn [pattern] ...)   ; kotobase.core/q
   :pull      (fn [eid pattern] ...)
   :datoms    (fn [] ...)}
  ```

  A production host partials these onto an open `kotobase.core`
  database; a test supplies `mem-db-api`. Nothing here can reach a
  network, hold a credential, or choose a tenant.

  ## Fail closed

  `store` refuses a nil or partial `db-api` rather than silently
  degrading to memory. The policy says `:database/memory :test-only` and
  `:policy/fail-closed-without-host-injection true`; an actor whose host
  wiring is missing must not come up quietly writing to a map that
  vanishes on restart.

  ## Encoding

  Compound values are stored as EDN-string blobs, the same codec ~190
  cloud-itonami stores hand-roll and `langchain-store` centralises, so
  the datom layer does not expand a nested order into sub-entities.
  Application-owned per the policy split (`:policy/application-owns
  [:datoms :queries :domain-schema :retention-classification]`)."

  Numbers, booleans and nil stay native so a backend can index and

  The tag is not decoration. Without it a stored `\"an order\"` is
  indistinguishable from a stored EDN blob, and decoding reads it back
  as the symbol `an` — silent, and exactly the kind of corruption that
  surfaces months later as a mangled record."

  Two attributes: the id (what `get-doc` looks up) and the whole

  Storing the document whole rather than fanning it out per attribute is
  deliberate. A domain map here has NAMESPACED keys — `:buyer/level`,
  `:order/sellers` — and fanning them into `:mp.<kind>/level` throws the
  namespace away, so `:buyer/level` reads back as `:level` and every
  consumer breaks silently. Preserving it would mean mangling the
  namespace into the attribute name, which is worse. The cost is that
  this layer supports lookup BY ID ONLY; nothing in it ever queried by
  another attribute, and a real datalog query belongs in the host with
  its own schema rather than being faked here.

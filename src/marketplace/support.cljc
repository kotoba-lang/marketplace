  "The bridge between a customer-support contact and a marketplace
  dispute — without either side deciding anything.

  ## The problem this solves

  `cloud-itonami-isic-8220` (call centres) logs customer contacts.
  `cloud-itonami-marketplace-crossborder` owns dispute intake. Today a
  buyer who phones to say \"my parcel never arrived\" produces a call
  record in one actor and nothing at all in the other, so the complaint
  dies in a log.

  A REFERRAL is the join: a support agent asserts *this contact is about
  this order, and the caller is claiming X*. That is all it asserts.

  ## What a referral must never become

  It must not carry an outcome. A support agent is the person most
  likely to form a view (\"the seller is clearly at fault\"), the least
  equipped to be held to it, and the most trusted by the caller — which
  is exactly why the contract refuses to carry one. `referral-errors`
  rejects any referral with an `:outcome`/`:fault`/`:liable` field, and
  `->dispute` produces an ordinary `marketplace.crossborder` dispute
  stamped non-adjudicating like any other.

  The fleet invariant holds unchanged: no actor adjudicates. A referral
  only moves a complaint from the place it was heard to the place it can
  be worked.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

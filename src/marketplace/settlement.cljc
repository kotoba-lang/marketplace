(ns marketplace.settlement
  "Multi-seller settlement — how one buyer payment becomes N seller
  payouts plus the operator's commission, without the operator ever
  taking custody.

  A marketplace basket differs from a shop basket in exactly one way
  that matters to money: its lines belong to DIFFERENT sellers. A
  single-store order (`kotoba.okaimono`) settles to one party; a
  marketplace order must split, and every split is a place where money
  can silently go missing. This namespace's central invariant is
  therefore CONSERVATION: for every plan, the sum of all allocations
  equals the amount the buyer paid, exactly, with no rounding leak.

  ## No custody (ADR-2607264000 D1 invariant 2)

  Nothing here moves money. A `settlement-plan` is a COMPUTATION — an
  auditable statement of who should receive what. Executing it is the
  settlement actor's separately human-approved step, and that actor's
  governor treats 'having moved funds' as a permanent scope exclusion.
  This mirrors `kotoba-lang/pay`'s own stated boundary ('zero network
  I/O, zero key custody'), whose `split-allocations` does the integer
  allocation arithmetic here.

  ## Units

  Amounts are INTEGER minor units of `:plan/currency` (yen, cents,
  paisa) — never floats, the `kotoba.reji` discipline. `pay.core/
  split-allocations` is unit-agnostic integer math, so passing minor
  units through it is sound; the `->pay-micros` bridge is provided
  separately for the USDC rail, where `pay`'s own unit is 6-decimal
  micros and conflating the two would be a real bug.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

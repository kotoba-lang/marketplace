(ns marketplace.listing
  "Listing admission and the buyer-facing search projection — the layer
  that decides whether an offer may become publicly visible, and how a
  buyer finds it.

  A LISTING is the public face of an OFFER: title, description, images,
  category, plus the compliance attestations the operator requires. An
  offer can exist in the catalog while its listing is refused (a seller
  can price an item the operator will not display).

  ## Restricted goods: a policy table, not a claim to know the law

  There is no honest way for a library to enumerate what every
  jurisdiction prohibits. This namespace therefore ships a small
  BASELINE of categories that essentially every consumer marketplace
  restricts, and otherwise takes the operator's own policy table as
  input. The baseline is deliberately a floor, not a legal opinion, and
  `restricted-baseline` says so in its own docstring. An operator
  running in a specific jurisdiction supplies `:policy` with their real
  list; this library never pretends to have derived one.

  Consistent with the fleet's non-adjudication discipline, a restricted
  category here produces a REFUSAL TO DISPLAY, never a finding that the
  seller did something unlawful. The listing actor's governor treats
  'finalizing a legality determination' as a permanent scope exclusion,
  exactly as ISIC 4791 does for fraud determinations.

  ## Search

  Projection targets `kotoba-lang/search` (`search.model`) rather than a
  bespoke index. KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: that
  library's `tokenize` matches runs of `[a-z0-9]` and CJK ranges, so a
  Japanese phrase like \"ワイヤレスイヤホン\" becomes ONE token and a
  query for \"イヤホン\" will not match it. There is no morphological
  segmentation upstream. The mitigation here is `:listing/keywords` —
  explicit seller/operator-supplied terms that land in `:search/tags`,
  which the buyer surface can also render as facets. Do not read the
  presence of a search projection as a claim of good Japanese recall.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

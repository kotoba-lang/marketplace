(ns marketplace.crossborder
  "Cross-border landed cost, HS classification PROPOSALS, and dispute
  intake — the layer that lets a marketplace ship across a border
  without any automated party ever claiming to have decided a customs
  or dispute question.

  ## What this namespace refuses to do

  It ships NO duty-rate table. Tariff schedules are jurisdiction-,
  product-, treaty- and date-specific, they change constantly, and a
  wrong rate is a financially consequential fabrication — a buyer
  quoted a landed cost that under-states duty pays the difference at
  the border. So every rate is an INPUT. When a rate for a
  (destination, HS heading) pair is absent, `landed-cost` returns
  `:landed/computable? false` with the missing input named, rather than
  a plausible-looking number. This is the same discipline
  `kotoba-lang/dynamics` states for pool-tap interventions
  (`:uncomputable-until-measured`) and `pricing-oracle` states for
  price bands (never predict from a prior, only from comparables
  actually present in the input).

  Likewise it never CLASSIFIES. `hs-proposal` builds a candidate HS
  heading with its basis and confidence, for a human to accept or
  reject. Customs classification is a legal act; an actor that recorded
  itself as having classified goods would be asserting an authority it
  does not have. `cloud-itonami-marketplace-crossborder`'s governor
  makes 'finalizing a customs declaration' a permanent scope exclusion,
  the same shape ISIC 4791 uses for fraud determinations.

  ## Disputes

  Disputes are INTAKE ONLY (ADR-2607264000 D5). This namespace records
  that a dispute exists, what evidence each side filed, and what a
  HUMAN decided — it contains no function that decides one. The fleet
  holds the invariant that no actor adjudicates a dispute, and this
  namespace does not break it.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

  "Portable seller credential — the federated-marketplace answer to
  'who is allowed to sell here, and can that survive leaving here?'

  A seller credential is a self-contained record asserting that a seller
  cleared onboarding at some ISSUING instance. It carries the evidence
  *references* (eKYC session completion + AML screening status) that the
  issuer relied on, so a RECEIVING instance can make its own admission
  decision without re-running the whole identity check and without
  calling back to the issuer. That is what makes this a protocol rather
  than a platform: an issuer cannot hold a seller hostage, because the
  credential is verifiable outside it (ADR-2607264000 D1 invariant 1).

  Composition, not reinvention:
    - `ekyc.core/completion` decides whether the identity session is
      evidentially complete (kotoba-lang/ekyc, modelling the ten
      non-face-to-face methods of 犯収法施行規則 6条1項).
    - `aml.core/status` reduces screening results to
      :clear / :review / :hold / :not-run (kotoba-lang/aml).

  NON-ADJUDICATING. Both upstream libraries stamp `:non-adjudicating
  true` on their records and this namespace preserves that discipline:
  nothing here *decides* that a person is who they claim to be, or that
  they are sanction-free. It decides only the much narrower question
  'given evidence the issuer already gathered, is this credential
  structurally admissible?' — and any answer other than a clean
  `:admissible` routes to a human. The onboarding actor's governor
  treats finalizing a KYC determination as a permanent scope exclusion.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness. Every time-dependent
  function takes `now` (an ISO-8601 UTC string) from the caller, the
  same discipline `kotoba.omise` uses for opening hours — lexicographic
  compare on ISO-8601 UTC is chronological compare."

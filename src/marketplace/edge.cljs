  "The HOST half of a marketplace actor, written once.

  Every actor in this marketplace is the same shape: a synchronous
  advisor/governor/phase core over a `Store`, and a host that has to get
  documents in front of it and writes out of it. The core differs per
  actor. The host does not — and the first version of it was copied into
  `orderops.edge.worker` and would have been copied into five more.
  This repo has watched that go wrong before (`cacao.cljc` reached ~25
  repos with a \"keep in sync\" comment and then diverged anyway), so the
  host lives here and the actors call it.

  ## What a host is for

  `kotoba-lang/kotobase-client` is Promise-based; the actor is
  synchronous. Making every `Store` protocol in the fleet async to suit
  one transport would be the tail wagging the dog, so the host brackets
  one actor pass instead:

      prefetch (the documents the request NAMES)
        -> seed a recording db-api
          -> run the actor, synchronously, exactly as the tests run it
        -> flush every recorded write in ONE transact

  The actor cannot tell the difference between this and a local map,
  which is the point: the same code path the test suite exercises is the
  one that runs in production.

  ## What this namespace refuses to do

  It mints no CACAO — the client does that, and
  `kotoba-lang/org-chainagnostic-cacao` owns the primitives. It holds no
  key material beyond reading the seed the platform hands it. It does
  not adjudicate, price or decide anything; every judgement stays in the
  actor's own governor.

  Bracket access (`aget`) throughout, for `:advanced-optimization`
  safety."

  CLAUDE.md's kotobase rule is that a Datalog join reaches exactly one
  ref: `open` takes a single `:ref-name`, so anything split across refs
  can never be joined again. Everything here wants joining — an order
  against the credential that admitted its seller, a payout against the
  delivery that earned it, a return against the order it came from — so
  every marketplace actor writes into this one ref and none of them
  shards.

  The cost, stated rather than discovered: one ref means one writer
  lease per commit at the storage layer, so throughput is bounded by
  CAS contention rather than by capacity. The rule's own answer to that
  is a single writer that batches, not a shard."

  "A ledger ordinal a Worker may actually use.

  The obvious implementation — a counter starting at 1 — is WRONG here,
  and shipped wrong once. `persist/append-event!` derives the entity id
  from the ordinal, so two isolates that each count from 1 write the
  same id and the second append silently replaces the first. The
  append-only audit ledger is the whole basis of the actor pattern's
  traceability claim; one that drops facts under concurrency is worse
  than none, because it still looks complete.

  So the ordinal carries its own uniqueness:

      <15-digit ms> - <4-digit within-request counter> - <isolate nonce>

  Sorting it lexically gives clock order across writers and exact order
  within a request. Two isolates writing in the same millisecond
  interleave arbitrarily — that is the honest limit of a multi-writer
  host, and it is a limit on ORDER, not on retention: nothing is lost.

  A globally monotonic sequence needs a single writer. The right one
  here is a Durable Object used purely as a serializer (CLAUDE.md: a DO
  is globally unique and single-threaded, so \"exactly one writer\" comes
  for free rather than being implemented with leases and fencing). That
  is a deliberate later step, not an oversight."

  is a fact about the apex, not a bug to route around.

  Every read is SIGNED. Skipping the CACAO mint (`:public? true`) looked

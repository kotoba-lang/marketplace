  "Warehouse fulfillment — pick, pack, hand over — and the first place in
  this stack where a ROBOT does the physical work.

  ## What `kotoba.robotics` is, and what it is not

  The fleet declares `:robotics true` on hundreds of blueprints, but the
  library itself is explicit: *policy, not control — it does not drive
  motors.* It models a mission, an action with a safety class, a
  safety-stop and a telemetry proof, and gives a governor the records it
  needs to refuse unsafe actuation **before it reaches hardware**.

  This namespace is the warehouse-side composition of that contract. It
  turns an order's sub-order into concrete pick/pack/handover tasks,
  proposes the robot actions each task needs, and answers the two
  questions a warehouse governor must ask:

    1. Is this action even about something in the order?
    2. Is this action's safety class dispatchable without a human?

  Nothing here talks to a robot. `dispatchable-actions` returns the
  actions a driver *may* be handed; handing them over is the operator's
  integration, deliberately outside this library — the same boundary
  `marketplace.settlement` draws around moving money.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."
